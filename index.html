<h1>More overtime</h1>
<div class ="icons">
<p>

   <img src="Data_Icons/car.png">The New York Police Department is slated to spend about $430 on overtime this year, about half of last year’s $848 million.
</p>
</div>
<h1>Fewer events</h1>
<div class ="icons">
<p><img src="Data_Icons/radio.png">Fewer parades and other events, less traffic and fewer after-school programs because of the pandemic have contributed to the decline in overtime spending.
</p>
</div>
<h1>Fewer officers</h1>
<div class ="icons">
<p><img src="Data_Icons/badge.png">The size of the force is also declining. There were 5% fewer uniformed officers in January 2021 than there were the previous year.
</p>
</div>
<h1>Over budget</h1>
<div class ="icons">
<p><img src="Data_Icons/glass.png">The city’s financial plan is providing for even fewer officers over the next five years. Despite these factors, the police department is still over budget on overtime spending. Only $268 million was allocated for this year’s overtime budget.
